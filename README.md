# Drone-Navigation

As part of my degree groups were required to create a navigational algorithm for a drone to take off, hover at 1.5 meters and fly over an arbitrary-shaped obstackle maintaining a constant height of 1.5 meters. The code was written in Python using ROS. Drone was simulated in Gazebo during the project, completed code was tested on an actual drone and performed well. 

The code was written by me and my classmate.
